RustJ is not a line-by-line Rust translation of `jsource`. Its goal is to preserve J's language and array semantics while building a modern compiler-oriented execution system in which CPU and GPU are peer targets.

The current implementation is transitional: a limited J frontend, direct CPU execution, Semantic IR, J Graph IR, early Logical IR, storage/SIMD code, sparse/boxed foundations, and experimental compiler analysis coexist while the final architecture is being made explicit.

---

## 1. Project goal

RustJ aims to implement:

> **A modern J array compiler/runtime in Rust that owns full J semantics and can compile analyzable regions to CPU, GPU, external compiler IRs, or verified library/custom-kernel routes without redefining the J language for compiler convenience.**

`jsource` remains the primary compatibility oracle for:

- observable J language semantics;
- word formation, enqueue, parser behavior, and name lookup timing;
- primitive corner cases;
- rank/cell/frame/agreement semantics;
- errors and error precedence;
- numeric promotion and tolerance;
- boxed/sparse semantics;
- reference differential testing.

The C J engine is not intended to become RustJ's normal fallback runtime.

---

```

The semantic meaning of a J program must not depend on the selected backend.

## 3. Original JAXA vision — “SQL for neural networks”

JAXA's original slogan was **“SQL for neural networks.”**

This did not mean writing neural networks in SQL syntax. It meant bringing the same separation of concerns that relational systems provide to neural-network and array computation:

```text
declarative computation intent
        ↓
logical array / NN graph
        ↓
algebraic rewrite / equivalence
        ↓
resource / locality / materialization analysis
        ↓
alternative physical plans
        ↓
target / resource / cost based selection
        ↓
CPU / GPU / library / accelerator execution
```

The user should express **what should be computed and which semantic constraints matter**, while the compiler decides how to realize that computation physically rather than requiring the user to prescribe kernels, tiles, devices, and schedules manually.

The database analogy is intentional:

| Database system | RustJ / JAXA vision |
|---|---|
| SQL query | declarative J/array/NN computation |
| relational algebra | J Graph IR / Graph Basis |
| logical rewrite | graph rewrite / equivalence |
| statistics/cardinality | shape/rank/access/resource facts |
| alternative query plans | alternative execution graphs/routes |
| cost model | ResourceEstimate / CostEstimate |
| physical operator selection | Execution Basis / backend realization |
| query executor | RustJ executor / external backend |

RustJ therefore has two complementary goals:

- **Direct goal:** a modern J compiler/runtime that preserves full J semantics.
- **Long-term research/product vision:** a declarative array-computing compiler core capable of realizing JAXA's “SQL for neural networks” idea.

This long-term vision does not turn RustJ into an NN framework or SQL-like DSL today. The immediate priority remains faithful J semantics and preserving J's high-level array algebra losslessly into compiler graphs. However, Graph Basis, rewrite/equivalence, resource analysis, and physical planning should be designed so that other array/NN frontends could eventually target the same compiler core.

This section preserves the original JAXA product/research north star: users describe declarative computation; the compiler generates and chooses physical plans.

## 4. Naming policy

`Jaxa` / `JAXA` is not the name of a current RustJ compiler component.

Historical repositories:

- `JAXA`
- `JAXA-complier`
- `japchae`
- `jaxa-analyzer`

are research/prototype sources. Their useful ideas are absorbed into RustJ's current components:

```text
Jaxa Analyzer      → J Graph analysis + Execution Semantic Lowering
Jaxa lowering      → J Graph IR → Logical Execution IR lowering
Jaxa optimizer     → J Graph algebraic optimizer + Logical Optimizer
Jaxa physical plan → Physical Planner / Physical Plan
```

New architecture decisions belong in `PROJECT.ko.md` first and are mirrored here.

---

# Part I — Frontend compatibility

## 4. Frontend principle

The frontend is not a place for RustJ-specific language simplification.

The compatibility model is:

```text
J Source
  ↓
word formation / tokenizer      ≈ current jsource w.c
  ↓
enqueuer                         ≈ jtenqueue
  ↓
parser                           ≈ current jsource p.c reduction system
  ↓
lossless FunctionEntity DAG
```

Representation may be Rust-native. Observable frontend semantics must remain J-compatible.

### 4.1 Word formation

The scanner must preserve:

- J word boundaries;
- character classes and scanner-state behavior;
- comments and quoted forms;
- numeric continuation/rewind rules;
- control words and punctuation boundaries.

Regex approximation is not the target architecture.

### 4.2 Enqueue

The enqueuer must preserve jsource-compatible behavior for:

- primitive lookup;
- noun/verb/adverb/conjunction classification;
- names and lookup metadata;
- assignment words;
- lookup timing;
- parser control classes.

Extension names remain ordinary J names and must not become tokenizer/parser keywords.

### 4.3 Parser

The parser must converge on the jsource reduction model rather than retain a separate RustJ convenience grammar.

The migration target is a single parser engine that handles, in J-compatible order:

- noun/verb application;
- adverb application;
- conjunction application;
- hook/fork/train construction;
- parentheses;
- assignment;
- name/POS lookup;
- parser-time constructor/error behavior.

Completed modifier applications are first-class J function entities before later train construction.

For example, the distinction between:

```text
Rank(Insert(+), 1)
```

and

```text
Insert(Rank(+, 1))
```

must survive parsing and downstream analysis.

### 4.4 Frontend migration checklist

Authoritative checklist: `PROJECT.ko.md`, section A0.5.

Current phase order:

```text
F0  Word formation differential compatibility
F1  Enqueuer separation / jtenqueue behavior
F2  Parse queue

P1  Parser stack/value model
P2  Unified jsource-compatible reduction engine
P3  Modifier/train construction semantics
P4  Name lookup / assignment sequencing
P5  Parser semantics vs compiler-fact separation
P6  Conformance gate
P7  Legacy convenience parser removal
P8  Handoff to compiler IR
```

The existing special-purpose modifier/train reducers are transitional and should disappear once the unified parser engine covers them.

---

# Part II — Semantic identity

## 5. FunctionEntity DAG

Large J-derived functions are represented as shared immutable graph entities rather than recursively copied trees.

The parser owns J construction identity.

Examples:

- primitive verb;
- applied adverb;
- applied conjunction;
- hook;
- fork;
- train;
- name reference;
- derived extension function.

The source operator remains the parent semantic identity. For example, applied `/` and `"` are not replaced in Semantic IR by execution-specific `Reduce` or `CellApply` nodes.

Those execution concepts are derived later.

### 5.1 No modifier summary fields as semantic identity

Legacy summary fields such as:

```text
reduce: bool
rank: Option<...>
```

must not replace the FunctionEntity topology.

Current implementation has removed the former `Verb.reduce`, `Verb.rank`, `Callable.reduce`, and `Callable.rank` semantic-summary dependencies.

### 5.2 Names and binding

J Name, BindingVersion, semantic FunctionEntity, and Logical SSA ValueId are distinct concepts.

Late-bound function names must retain J semantics unless specialization is justified by a binding/version witness or runtime guard.

Names must not be globally snapshotted at sentence start if doing so changes J's observable right-to-left lookup or assignment behavior.

---

# Part III — Rank, cells, and array semantics

## 6. Logical J array meaning

A J noun remains logically:

```text
type + shape + ordered atoms/value
```

Physical representation details such as:

- strides;
- offset;
- tiling;
- alignment;
- address space;
- device placement;
- sharding;
- transfer;
- buffer identity;

do not belong to J noun semantics.

## 6.1 Rank conjunction vs implicit cell application

The explicit rank conjunction `"` and implicit rank/cell iteration are different concepts.

- `"` is a J conjunction with operands and parser identity.
- implicit rank execution is function-application semantics driven by callable rank and argument rank.

Nested rank boundaries must not be flattened until fill/assembly/error equivalence is proven.

## 6.2 CellApply

Logical `CellApply` represents implicit J cell execution.

It must preserve:

- frame/cell decomposition;
- J prefix frame agreement;
- residual-frame repetition;
- fill/prototype behavior on empty frames;
- result-cell type/shape joining;
- assembly errors;
- observable evaluation/error behavior.

A fixed-shape parallel map may replace it only after the necessary uniformity proofs exist.

---

# Part IV — J Graph IR

## 7. Purpose

J Graph IR preserves algebraic graph structure for reasoning before execution-specific normalization erases useful J structure.

Current schema: **v0.3**.

It includes:

- explicit applied-operation nodes;
- combinator regions;
- GraphFacts;
- Graph Basis;
- graph hints;
- symbolic operation/resource contracts;
- use counts and liveness;
- algebraic rewrite candidates;
- equivalence witnesses;
- resource-expression provenance.

## 7.1 Graph Basis and Execution Basis are different

RustJ intentionally has two basis layers.

### Graph Basis

Used for JAXA-style graph algebra and access-pattern reasoning.

Current vocabulary includes:

- Elementwise
- CellApply
- Reduce
- Window
- StaticReindex
- DynamicGather
- Search
- Structured

The lower bound is not scalar arithmetic. It should preserve algorithm/access identity far enough for rewrite, locality, fusion, and resource reasoning.

### Execution Basis

Used for executable normalization and lowering.

Examples include:

- Elementwise
- CellApply
- Reduce
- WindowView
- StaticReindex
- Gather
- Contract
- LookupClassify
- other execution families

A structured graph operation such as convolution may remain a black box in Graph Basis while later lowering to WindowView + Contract or to a library/custom kernel.

## 7.2 Window / Prefix-Infix

J `u\` is preserved as `GraphForm::PrefixInfix`.

Graph Basis exposes a Window access family.

For example:

```text
(+/)\
```

is represented conceptually as:

```text
Window
  ↓
Reduce
```

rather than being collapsed into one opaque special case.

Whether Scan deserves a separate Graph Basis identity remains an open basis-taxonomy question.

---

# Part V — Rewrite and equivalence

## 8. Optimization dependency order

The architecture fixes the following dependency:

```text
Basis discovery
    ↓
Rewrite candidate generation
    ↓
Equivalence validation
    ↓
Candidate resource evaluation
    ↓
Sound resource pruning
    ↓
Later costing/selection
```

Rewrite rules must not silently mutate the source J Graph node. They produce sidecar candidates with provenance.

## 8.1 Rewrite registry

Current minimum registry contains a witnessed rule for J Find:

```text
x E. y
   Search
     ⇅  J Dictionary equivalence witness
Window
  ↓
CellApply(Match)
```

The original Search node remains intact.

Each candidate records:

- source J Graph ValueId;
- source span;
- source Graph Basis;
- rule identity;
- equivalence witness;
- replacement graph;
- rewrite-specific fact rule.

The verifier recomputes rule-derived facts and rejects stale or invented facts.

## 8.2 Current Find rewrite path

For the currently supported RustJ `E.` subset:

- source rank and pattern rank are at most 1;
- result dtype is Bool;
- result shape preserves the right argument shape;
- the logical window family has one logical position per right-argument position;
- trailing non-fitting windows remain positions whose match result is false.

The candidate can therefore infer a logical Window shape such as:

```text
right shape [6]
pattern shape [3]
→ logical window family shape [6, 3]
```

while still leaving representation and physical realization downstream.

---

# Part VI — Graph facts and resource model

## 9. GraphFacts

GraphFacts is intentionally separate from execution `Facts`.

Graph IR owns target-independent logical facts:

- dtype;
- shape;
- rank;
- graph analyzability.

It does not import execution layout facts.

Primitive semantic transfer rules may be shared, but GraphFacts and execution Facts remain distinct containers/domains.

## 9.1 Static memory interpretation

JAXA's "static memory" claim is interpreted as logical determinability, not physical buffer assignment.

J Graph analysis may determine:

- logical extent;
- use count;
- value lifetime;
- materialization opportunity;
- retained values;
- logical storage obligation;
- symbolic state requirement.

It must not prematurely own:

- BufferId;
- byte offset;
- register count;
- shared-memory address;
- physical stride/layout;
- device allocation.

Those belong to later planning.

## 9.2 ResourceExprGraph

Current resource analysis uses symbolic expressions such as:

- Zero
- Unknown
- ValueAtoms(value)
- Requirement(value, kind)
- Sum(...)
- Max(...)
- Scale(...)

This preserves provenance for resource summaries rather than reducing everything to an unexplained number.

Tracked graph-level quantities include:

- internal logical edge volume;
- elidable materialization volume;
- retained live volume;
- graph-order peak live volume;
- baseline internal read+write traffic;
- potentially elidable traffic;
- temporary state;
- reduction accumulator state;
- window working-set state.

## 9.3 Resource-state lifetime

Temporary/accumulator/working-state requirements carry canonical graph-order lifetime records.

A state may be marked as potentially extending across fusion.

Region analysis keeps both:

- canonical graph-order peak state;
- a conservative all-child-state upper bound.

This avoids treating graph-order locality as proof that a fused realization has the same lifetime.

---

# Part VII — Resource-aware rewrites

## 10. Candidate resource evaluation

Graph rewrite candidates are evaluated in the same target-independent domain as their source:

- logical atoms;
- internal materialization;
- read/write traffic;
- symbolic state requirements.

Known and unknown are never conflated.

If implementation-local costs are unknown, resource metric ordering is `Incomparable`.

Current Find rewrite example:

- result extent is known;
- logical window extent can be known for the supported rank≤1 subset;
- WindowWorkingSet lower bound can be derived from pattern extent;
- structural/composite implementation state may remain unknown.

Therefore the rewrite can be resource-analyzable without claiming complete cost knowledge.

## 10.1 Sound pruning contract

Early resource pruning requires both:

```text
ResourceBoundLocality::Local
+
PruningMonotonicity::ProvenMonotone
```

Without both proofs, candidates remain available and are evaluated later.

The current Find rewrite does **not** satisfy this early-pruning proof contract.

---

# Part VIII — Execution lowering and target feasibility

## 11. Logical Execution IR

Execution Semantic Lowering derives executable dataflow from the semantic/J Graph representation.

Logical IR owns:

- explicit operation/value flow;
- semantic checks;
- effect summaries;
- possible-error facts;
- speculation/evaluation-order constraints;
- execution-basis identity;
- execution-basis payload;
- resolved call/rank facts.

It must not contain target-specific schedule decisions.

## 11.1 WindowView payload

`ExecutionBasis::WindowView` now has explicit semantic payload support:

```text
WindowView {
    source,
    shape: PatternShape { pattern }
}
```

Expansion verification checks that payload provenance agrees with actual inputs.

Standalone WindowView lowering is still incomplete.

## 11.2 Composite rewrite realization

A witnessed rewrite does not require every Graph Basis node to have a standalone kernel.

The Find rewrite currently has a CPU `ReferenceRewriteComposite` realization for the supported rank≤1 `E.` subset.

That route:

- preserves the Window → CellApply(Match) graph model;
- validates the same current RustJ Find semantics;
- can execute the whole rewrite as one reference composite;
- does not pretend that standalone WindowView is already generally lowerable.

GPU support for this rewrite remains unavailable until an appropriate realization exists.

## 11.3 Target-only feasibility

Existing `LoweringRegistry + TargetCapabilities` is reused.

Rewrite target feasibility reports:

- Supported
- RequiresCallFacts
- Unsupported

This is deliberately weaker than final legality.

It does not invent call-dependent facts such as:

- purity;
- observable error freedom;
- evaluation-order freedom;
- reassociation legality;
- precise access relation.

## 11.4 Planning reports

A `RewritePlanningReport` combines:

- target feasibility;
- resource evaluation;
- rule pruning permission.

Current readiness states:

- TargetUnsupported
- NeedsCallFacts
- NeedsResourceFacts
- ReadyForCosting

It does not select a winning candidate.

Actual selection requires later `TargetProfile / ResourceEstimate / CostProfile` integration.

---

# Part IX — Target architecture

## 12. Target model

Do not collapse target identity into one opaque object.

The target model is layered:

```text
BackendFamily
   ↓
ArchitectureTarget
   ↓
DeviceProfile
   ↓
RuntimeProfile
   ↓
resolved TargetProfile
```

Compiler-specific target lookup is separate from user J locales.

```text
device
  → architecture
  → architecture family
  → backend family
  → cpu/gpu class
  → generic
```

Lookup discovers candidates. Legality/resource/cost analysis chooses among them.

## 12.1 Built-ins and extensions

Hardware lowering applies uniformly to built-in J primitives and extension-derived operations.

Do not create a special hardware path only for extensions.

---

# Part X — Flow–Storage and materialization

## 13. Identity separation

Keep these identities distinct:

```text
SSA ValueId
≠ semantic StateResource
≠ physical BufferId
```

Likewise:

```text
semantic StorageRequirement
≠ physical MaterializationDecision
```

## 13.1 Materialization choices

Planning may eventually choose among:

- KeepVirtual
- FuseAway
- RegisterResident
- WorkingStateResident
- Bufferize(memory_space)
- Rematerialize(recompute_source_or_region)
- ExternalResource

Rematerialization is a physical/schedule choice, not deletion of semantic identity.

Its legality requires proofs for effects, errors, state dependencies, name bindings, and observable ordering.

---

# Part XI — Historical JAXA inheritance audit

## 14. Principles retained

Repeated review of `JAXA`, `JAXA-complier`, `japchae`, and `jaxa-analyzer` confirms that RustJ should preserve the following research ideas:

1. J notation creates useful graph structure that should survive parsing.
2. Basis should reflect meaningful access patterns rather than scalar arithmetic atoms.
3. Rewrite/equivalence reasoning belongs above physical realization.
4. Resource reasoning should be symbolic and compositional.
5. Flow and Storage are related but distinct analyses.
6. Static memory means logical determinability, not early physical offsets.
7. High-level structured operations may remain graph black boxes.
8. Backend realization may decompose or fuse them later.

## 14.1 Ideas intentionally not inherited as hard rules

Do not regress to superseded prototype assumptions such as:

- special `"RjP` precision syntax;
- rank change always being a fusion boundary;
- all reshape/transpose always being zero-copy;
- complete physical graph determination at parse time;
- fixed physical buffer offsets in semantic/J Graph IR;
- hardware register numbers embedded in primitive semantics;
- pre-resolving all names before the J parser uses them.

Current jsource remains the frontend semantic oracle.

---

# Part XII — Validation policy

## 15. Semantic validation

For semantic changes:

- add reproducer/regression coverage;
- compare against pinned jsource where available;
- test word formation, enqueue, parser, and execution at the appropriate layer;
- preserve J error class even when diagnostics become richer;
- do not claim validation that was not actually run.

The user has requested that current development not depend on remote CI; source-level review and direct/local checks should be reported accurately.

## 15.1 Differential frontend validation

Frontend compatibility should eventually provide separate differential gates for:

1. word formation;
2. enqueue classification/metadata;
3. parser reduction behavior and result topology.

A mismatch in a test harness must first be distinguished from a true semantic mismatch.

---

# Part XIII — Current implementation status

## 16. Completed or substantially implemented

- shared immutable FunctionEntity semantic DAG;
- removal of legacy reduce/rank semantic summary fields;
- recursive derived-function fact inference;
- J Graph IR explicit operation graph;

- Find Search → Window + CellApply(Match) candidate;
- rewrite-specific fact rules and verifier;
- conservative source-vs-replacement resource evaluation;
- soundness contract for resource pruning;
- target-only rewrite feasibility bridge;
- planning readiness reports;
- WindowView execution payload;

- wider primitive coverage.

## 16.2 Deferred / later

- production CUDA backend;
- broad AD/VJP transforms;
- aggressive resource pruning;
- mature multi-route partitioning;
- complete full-J implementation.

AD/VJP should not leap ahead of Basis/Rewrite/Equivalence foundations.

---

# Part XIV — Near-term roadmap

## 17. Priority order

Current preferred order:

```text
1. Finish jsource-faithful frontend migration
2. Continue Graph Basis vocabulary / graph facts
3. Extend witnessed rewrite rules conservatively
4. Improve rewrite-specific resource facts
5. Add executable lowering families only with semantic proof
6. Connect full TargetProfile / ResourceEstimate
7. Add CostProfile and candidate ranking
8. Add sound pruning where proofs exist
9. Expand backend realizations
10. Later graph transforms such as AD/VJP
```

For the current Find rewrite specifically:

```text
Search source
  ↓
witnessed Window + CellApply(Match) candidate
  ↓
known result facts
  ↓
known rank≤1 logical window extent
  ↓
partial symbolic resource profile
  ↓
CPU ReferenceRewriteComposite available
  ↓
remaining:
  - richer state/resource size inference
  - general standalone WindowView route
  - full cost model
  - GPU realization
```

Design work is authored in Korean canonical files first. English mirrors are updated to remain semantically aligned for external readers.

If a discrepancy exists, the Korean canonical file is authoritative.

Code identifiers, comments, doc comments, test names, diagnostics, and commit messages remain English unless a specific case requires otherwise.


---

## License policy

RustJ's public open-source distribution path is GNU General Public License version 3, `GPL-3.0-only`.

RustJ also preserves a separate commercial-licensing path in the same general direction as current `jsource`. A commercial RustJ license may be granted only to the extent that the applicable RustJ copyright holder(s) actually possess the rights needed to relicense the relevant material.

Where commercial use or distribution of RustJ depends on code or other rights derived from J SOURCE, the necessary Jsoftware commercial J SOURCE license and other upstream rights must also be obtained and complied with. RustJ's `LICENSE` does not itself grant Jsoftware-owned commercial rights.

Current policy:

- public RustJ distribution without the necessary Jsoftware commercial rights: `GPL-3.0-only`
- where the necessary Jsoftware commercial rights and RustJ-side rights are both available: a separate RustJ commercial license may be offered
- external Contributions must grant the project the rights in `CLA.ko.md` / `CLA.md` needed for GPL distribution and separate commercial relicensing
- the CLA does not transfer contributor copyright to the project
- the CLA does not expand any rights owned by Jsoftware or another third party

`LICENSE` is the governing notice and `COPYING` contains the full GNU GPL v3 text. Cargo metadata remains `license = "GPL-3.0-only"` for the public open-source option. Do not change it back to `GPL-3.0-or-later`.
